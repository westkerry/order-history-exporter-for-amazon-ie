Browser extension for exporting your Amazon order history to JSON or CSV format. Supports both **Firefox** and **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.). While it is designed for use with [Toolbox for Firefly III](https://github.com/xenolphthalein/toolbox-for-firefly-iii) to enrich financial transactions with Amazon order details, it can be used independently for personal record-keeping or data analysis.

## Installation

### From Browser Stores

- Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/order-history-exporter-fo/fipfbjgikgcggcebnefmamgemoehfgof
- Firefox Add-ons: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/order-history-exporter-amazon/

### From Source

Requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xenolphthalein/order-history-exporter-for-amazon.git
cd order-history-exporter-for-amazon

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for all browsers (Firefox + Chrome)
npm run build

# Or build for a specific browser
npm run build:firefox
npm run build:chrome
```

`npm install` also runs the repository's `prepare` script, which installs Husky git hooks.

The built extensions will be in browser-specific directories:
- **Firefox**: `dist/firefox/` — Load via `about:debugging` → "This Firefox" → "Load Temporary Add-on"
- **Chrome/Chromium**: `dist/chrome/` — Load via `chrome://extensions` → "Developer mode" → "Load unpacked"

---

## Usage

1. Install the extension in your browser (Firefox or Chrome/Chromium)
2. Navigate to Amazon and log in to your account
3. Click the extension icon in the toolbar
4. Select your export options (date range, format)
5. Click "Export" to download your order history
6. To cancel an export in progress, reopen the popup and click "Stop Export"

## Release Automation

Tagged releases (`v*.*.*`) run `.github/workflows/release.yml` and now:

- builds Firefox and Chrome artifacts
- creates a GitHub Release with downloadable files
- publishes to Chrome Web Store (stable tags only)
- submits to Firefox Add-ons (listed channel, stable tags only)

Prerelease tags (for example `v1.2.3-beta.1`) still create a GitHub Release, but skip Chrome/Firefox store publishing.
